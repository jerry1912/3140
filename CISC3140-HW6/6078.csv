11/4/2019 15:29:38,4,3,5,4,I learned about Microsoft SQL server management studio and how to use the software. It was informative that he explained the different data types through the different systems like it is integer in Oracle. ,I liked how he gave us a mini demonstration of the Microsoft sql server management studio. It was a different approach compared to PowerPoint presentations which gives us a better practical understanding of MSSMS.  ,"One change I would advise to the presenter to make their presentation more effective is explain the concepts more in depth. Also, it was very hard to see the demonstration because the text was very small. ",
11/4/2019 15:29:54,4,4,4,5,Microsoft SQL server management studio - process for database at real work. showing the detail of SQL studio(year 2005). How to mange the project table by using the Microsoft SQL server management studio.,Showing the application and explain how to work . Also having the some project (his project) to show how the SQL studio workout. Also showing how will be easier for us as a developer by using the Microsoft SQL server management studio . ,"maybe putting the detail into the power point not just talking about it but showing the English word into the power point. It will easier to follow the detail (because it is too fast , can't really understand the meaning of it) . ",n/a
11/4/2019 15:31:39,5,5,5,5,"I only knew how to work with postgresql, so ssms was very interesting to learn. SSMS sql server management studio is a microsoft based sql. The software that shows the sql database was presented to the class as well as given a demo of how to create new tables. ",the presenter was showing real life demos about ssms. He showed us how to create a new table and how query the table. The presenter showed us how easy we can make our lives by using ssms because we just have to put in little information and the software will create the documents itself.,"The presenter chose to give us a demo to explain how it works, but rather than simplifying it, I was more confused because it was not used in an actual project or app, so there was no way I could have learned how to use it in reality.",
11/4/2019 15:32:37,5,5,5,5,The presentation was about the Microsoft sql Server management system. This is a new topic for me. I am now learning oracle database sql. This new sql seems more flexible and easier to code or access for me. The presenter convinced me to learn more about it.,"The presenter was talking about the SQL server in Microsoft. It is basically a software application. The presenter did good in showing some features using the actual application. By seeing the actual how to use the application, i am convinced and am interested in the application.","While showing the features and functions in the application. There were some errors occuring. And also, the presenter took a little time looking for the feature to show us. That interrupted a little the pace of the presentation.",good
11/4/2019 15:32:39,4,4,4,5,Learned about SQL server management studio. Learned more about how to set up a database. Learned about SQL more and how to set up use. He did an in class demo of what he would do in his database. He explain different points of his database. ,He used different examples when explaining his database. His presentation was short and simple and his slides were easy to understand. He tried his best and seemed somewhat prepared to present about his topic,He tends to lose focus and lose my focus at times. During the presentation he didnt speak as clearly as I wouldve liked. Maybe do more preparation and better topic. His presentation seemed boring and maybe adding more exciting elements would have been very good for his presentation.  ,
11/4/2019 15:33:24,5,5,5,5,"The presenter talked about SQL and management studio and how to use it. He portrayed how to create a database, table, and columns. There are different types of databases types, for example, int or float in Microsoft SQL, and maybe it would be called number in another. This example was shown using a GUI, which is quicker than actually writing the code. Primary keys were used for ID numbers. ","The presenter effectively displayed how to use a management studio for creating a working database. He actually used the software to show what he was talking about and where to find it, instead of talking about it without using it. He compared the code to using the software and it saves time, that actually showed us how it works. ","The presenter perhaps could have went more in depth about the software itself and how it works behind the scenes instead of just using the software. He also worked an example on the fly, maybe it would have saved time to explain important information by already having a basic example set up.",
11/4/2019 15:33:36,4,3,3,3,I learned that SSMS stands for SQL Server Management Studio. There are different data types in SSMS and might be different compared to other servers but are mostly similar. I learned how to create a primary key and when you use the management studio you can change from no to yes which can make it automatically fill in the primary keys. I learned that a good thing about SSMS is that it helps us save a lot of time. ,The presenter had a lot of visual examples about SSMS and had even showed everyone how to use SSMS instead of just talking about it. The presenter explained to everyone step by step how to make a table and primary key. ,The presenter could explain more slowly about what SSMS is and have more information about it because there weren't many slides about what it is and all the presenter did was give examples. The presenter should do more research on the topic because it seemed like it wasn't very well thought out. The presenter should also zoom in because the letters are tiny in the management studio making it really hard for people to see. ,
11/4/2019 15:33:37,3,4,4,4,"I learned about Microsoft SQL server, and the different database features one can use when using the database. I also got a review of some basic sql commands which was helpful. It was great finally getting a hands-on example of sql server after hearing about it for so long.","It was a very interesting topic and the presenter was definitely knowledgeable about his topic. I think that helped his presentation tremendously. If he was less knowledgable, it would make the presentation less interesting. Also, I enjoyed the hands-on approach he took. The examples and walkthrough was very helpful. ",I think the presenter can make more eye contact instead of looking at the screen for most of the time. I also think the presenter should be more organized when presenting. It didn't seem to flow well and there were a lot of pauses when he was going through the tool.,Great job!
11/4/2019 15:33:49,3,3,4,3,"I learnt about Microsoft SQL server managehent. I got an overlook of the IDE he was using during demonstration. I also learnt about SSMS, the good and the bad about it. I thing he was talking about queries in a database. ",It was really nice of him to show us what he was talking about. The presentation got more better when he talked about the the goods and the bads of using SSMS and went on talking about his personal experience.,His demonstration was unclear. I wish he went into detail and explained firsthand what he was trying to achieve with the demonstration. I was lost many times throughout his demonstration and couldn't quite grasp the purpose of it. ,
11/4/2019 15:45:48,3,3,4,3,"I learned how to create a table using SSMS, which stands for SQL server management studio. He mentioned advantages and disadvantages of SSMS, however I was unable to hear him because he was a bit unclear. There wasn’t a lot that I was able to learn because the presentation was fairly short.","The presenter had his main topics listed on the presentation as a reminder of what to speak about, so he knew his topic very well. However, as mentioned before, it was hard to hear him so it would have been better if he included more information – for the non-auditory learners.","While it was nice to see how to create a table from scratch in SQL, my suggestion for improvement would be maybe to include screenshots of step by step of how to do it so that we can better understand what he is doing.  As well as provide some background information of what SQL is and what it is used for. ",
11/5/2019 12:03:00,3,3,5,5,I learned about Microsoft software that lets users create and modify SQL databases. The software looks very clean and modern and has easy GUI interface that lets even beginners to pick up relatively easy. ,"what worked for the presenter was some examples on how to use Microsoft's SQL server management studio, the student showed how to start up the software and get started with connecting to a server, they then displayed how to create different tables and columns and how to execute statements that you want.","The student could have been more organized with their presentation, even though i liked how the student showed how to use the software instead of just having slide presentations on it, it was somewhat hard to follow and i got lost sometimes, but that could have been due to time constraint the student had on their presentation.",
11/5/2019 13:16:54,2,2,4,3,I learned that Microsoft SQL management studio exist. I also learned how not to do a presentation in the future. I also learned that communication skills are very important and might be an important factor in your interview.,"Unfortunately, nothing worked well at all. Everything worked against him. He was trying to show us how SMSS works but he got lost and could not explain anything to us. I was trying really hard to understand him.","I would suggest him to redo his presentation. I would like to see better organization, more slides with proper comments on the side, maybe get rid of actual coding by himself and for him to be more patient.",
11/6/2019 11:44:54,3,3,3,3,I learned that the Microsoft SQL server management studio does not always require users to write long SQL statements compared to other SQL software. Users can still write them down despite being optional.,"Menghong manages to present us the Microsoft SQL server management studio on his presentation, showing some functionalities of it. He also shortly told the audience the advantages and disadvantages in using SSMS.","Menghong should explain to us how we can install the SSMS onto our computer, such as which website we should go to download it. He should also add more details about the disadvantages of using SSMS. He said that some computers do not support it, but he needs to explain which one.",
11/6/2019 13:44:13,5,5,5,5,"For this presentation, The Microsoft sql server management studio is most best database software, because Microsoft sql server management studio have a lot of good to create the object in the table and show a lot of columns name, data type, and allow nulls for the database.","For this presentation, Presenter show us how to create object of the column name, data type, allow nulls in the Microsoft sql server management studio. Microsoft sql server management studio was the best software application first lunch to create the database.","For this presentation, Presenter should be give more background picture and video for Microsoft sql server management studio in the powerpoint, and Maybe should provide a little more detail about the Microsoft sql server management studio increase people use this software in the future.",
11/6/2019 15:32:43,3,4,4,4,Learned more about the uses of database system and how databases work and how it could be implemented into future products. Learned about about Microsoft SQL management studio and their database products.,Presenter gave a very informed presentation that went in depth into his topic about database manipulation and Microsoft SQL. Presenter clearly researched his topic well and gave a well structured presentation format.,Maybe the presenter could've shown some of the sql code and demonstrated some queries to show a more hands on presentation but overall the presentation was very information and had a lot of information.,
11/6/2019 22:03:01,5,5,5,5,Something new I learned from this presentation that I didn't know before was a couple new syntax in SQL that I didn't know before. I also learned that SQL stand for Structured Query Language which I didn't know before.,The thing that worked well for the presenter was that he had a good amount of images in his presentation. His presentation would be very helpful for somebody who just started or trying to learn SQL. Very informative presentation.,The only thing I would've suggest to make his presentation to be more effective would be that he should have coded some of the basics of the structure query language for people who were knew to learning this. It would've gave them a better understanding on how it works.,Very informative!
11/11/2019 0:21:18,3,4,4,3,I have learned and used Microsoft SQL software. This is a relatively easy to use and convenient for beginners to use software. We've learned everything the presenter has to say. Software is mainly used to connect to back-end servers to store and manipulate information.,"The content demonstrated by the presenter is relatively basic and simple, which is conducive to students who are first exposed to database and SQL to understand the content. The software recommended by the presenter is easy to use and is a good tool for beginners to learn and use. The examples are simple and easy to understand.","The examples in the presentation are too simple and boring for students with basic knowledge. Instead of just showing the code, you need to analyze how the results are generated. The presenter needs to show more software features. Simply recommending this software cannot attract students to use it.",
11/12/2019 16:53:22,5,5,5,5,"SQL Server Management Studio is a software application first launched with Microsoft SQL Server 2005 that is used for configuring, managing, and administering all components within Microsoft SQL Server.","He is familiar to his topic and explain how to use the software. He demonstrated how to interrupt SQL code in the software, and it is easy to understand. And he shows us why it is important to learn SQL.","He can add some background of this software, and show more examples for SQL database. He could speak loudly and make eye contact with audiences.                             
                                                 ",
11/21/2019 15:06:00,2,3,3,2,"The presentation was an attempt to teach us some of the basics of Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. However, besides the fact that it's some kind of program that works with databases unfortunately I wasn't able to learn anything new.",Unfortunately nothing really worked well for the presenter. The presentation lacked organization and many other things. The presenter didn't seem very prepared for the presentation either and didn't do a very good job explaining the topic.,Some of the suggestions I that I think would help the presenter would be to add some slides and spend more time organizing the presentation. Probably adding an outline to summarize all of the topics discussed would also be good.,
11/21/2019 17:04:28,5,5,5,5,For this presentation I learned a lot about Microsoft SQL server management studio and some things you can do with it like how to make/manage a table and some other stuff. I also learned that Microsoft has its own SQl management tools.,One thing that the presenter did that worked very well was using his own stuff as examples and showing us real examples of what he was explaining. A lot of people explain stuff but do not show how to use it practically this made the presentation much easier to follow.,The presenter did a very good job and I do not have much that I can suggest so that he can improve. The presenter did a great job getting their point across and I leaned a lot that I can use myself in the future.,
